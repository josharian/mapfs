This is a fork of the MapFS component of the Go standard library's testing/fstest package.

It exists to allow me (and anyone else affected) to work around https://github.com/golang/go/issues/46776.

I plan to keep it around forever, for the convenience of anyone depending on it, but I do not plan to maintain it long term, as I hope that upstream fixes will make it unnecessary.

It is released under the same BSD-like license as the Go project.
